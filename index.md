### CPSC 120L favorite labs

* Lab 6 part-1

This lab was one of my favorite labs because it was really interesting to incorporate if statements into a word game. I liked how this lab allowed me to think creatively as I tested my programs. At first, it was a bit challenging because I had never heard of the Mad Libs word game before. But after I was done programming the Mad Libs game into the sandwich file it was very amusing to fill in the blanks for  “protein, bread, and condiment” with my partner. This helped me realize that computer science is a field where the projects that we code can be enjoyable and not always focused on solving serious issues. I learned how to integrate command line arguments with user input. I also was able to understand that the index and elements are contained in the command line. Understanding the command line has helped me visualize how I want the input to be read. Overall this lab assignment was rigorous and also helped me build problem-solving skills that I can use for future labs. 


* Lab 5 part-1 

This lab was also one of my favorite labs because I learned how programs use multiple files to execute a function. This was the first time I wrote a function file and a separate file that called it. This lab helped me visualize how coding a program to calculate the area of a rectangle is much more complex than simply doing it by myself with an actual calculator. But at the end of the lab, it was so satisfying to see how this program made accurate calculations. I enjoyed running through the test cases and debugging any errors I ran into. Additionally, I like how this lab allowed me to consistently use my notebook to plan each program. Throughout this lab assignment I was able to learn how to call functions and build a habit of compiling frequently. I believe this assignment was a key part of my programming journey because it taught me the importance of planning and frequently testing my programs. At the end of this lab I built a solid foundation of coding programs by using strategic planning strategies. 


* Lab 8 part-1

This part of the lab was my favorite because I learned how to use loops in my program and also validate user input. I had always heard about loops in computer science, but had never really understood their application in programs until this class. Furthermore, I admire how this lab tested my ability to recall and code key concepts from previous labs such as command line arguments. I enjoyed writing my plan out for the JudgeAverage function which calculated the mean average of scores after the minimum and maximum had been eliminated. I believe this part of the lab ultimately reinforced my systematic thinking skills in programming. It also allowed me to integrate mathematical logic into coding, which broadened my understanding of computer science. At the end of the lab, I learned how to use loops in order to integrate user input into my program.
